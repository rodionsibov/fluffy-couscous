  The Angular CanDeactivate route guard is called, whenever we navigate away
  from the route before the current component gets deactivated.
</p>

<p>
  The best use case for CanDectivate route guard is the form component. The user
  may have filled the data in the form and tries to leave that component without
  saving his work. The CanDeactivate guard gives us a chance to warn the user
  that he has not saved his work and give him a chance to cancel the navigation.
